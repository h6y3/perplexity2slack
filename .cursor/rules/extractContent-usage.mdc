# `extractContent()` Usage Guideline

When extracting text from a Perplexity response within `[content.js](mdc:content.js)` for copying or formatting, **always use the `extractContent()` function**.

Do not call `extractStructuredText()` directly.

- `extractContent()` is the primary public function for this purpose and handles necessary pre-processing, such as citation removal from the DOM.
- `extractStructuredText()` is an internal helper function and should only be called from within `extractContent()`.

**Rationale:** Calling `extractStructuredText()` directly may bypass crucial preprocessing steps, leading to incomplete or incorrect content extraction and potentially breaking the copy-to-clipboard functionality. This rule is critical for maintaining the integrity of the content extraction pipeline.
